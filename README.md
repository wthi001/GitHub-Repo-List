GitHub-Repo-List
Module 11 Checkpoint 6 Assignment

Your team is working on an app that will help recruiters review all of a candidates information. You've been assigned to work on one feature for the app - to display a list of repos belonging to a particular GitHub handle.

Review GitHub's API documentation for the list user repositories endpoint to understand how this endpoint works.
Create an app and push it to GitHub.
When you're done, submit the link to your GitHub repo at the bottom of the page.
Requirements:

The search must trigger a call to GitHub's API.
The repos associated with that handle must be displayed on the page.
You must display the repo name and link to the repo URL.
The user must be able to make multiple searches and see only the results for the current search.
